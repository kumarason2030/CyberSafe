        <p style="font-size: 27px;"><b>Learn about cybersecurity and protect yourself online</b></p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">India has witnessed a significant surge in cybercrimes, particularly in the financial sector. In the fiscal year ending March 2024, high-value cyber fraud cases increased over fourfold, resulting in losses exceeding $20 million. Scammers have employed advanced techniques, such as artificial intelligence and deepfake technology, to impersonate officials and deceive individuals into transferring funds. For instance, a prominent textile magnate was defrauded of $830,000 through a meticulously orchestrated scam involving a fake online Supreme Court hearing.Additionally, in September 2024, hackers used Telegram chatbots to leak sensitive data from Star Health, India's largest health insurer, exposing personal and medical information of millions. The escalating frequency and sophistication of these cybercrimes underscore the critical importance of cybersecurity awareness among the general populace. With India's rapid digital transformation, individuals are increasingly vulnerable to online threats. Educating oneself about safe online practices, such as recognizing phishing attempts, safeguarding personal information, and using strong, unique passwords, is essential. The government has initiated awareness campaigns and established resources like the Cyber Swachhta Kendra to assist citizens in protecting their digital assets. .However, a proactive approach from individuals, including staying informed about emerging threats and exercising caution in digital interactions, remains paramount in mitigating the risks posed by cybercriminals.</p>
